# HackerRank
I solved HackerRank question the question is...
Add 20 buttons to the page arranged in a row, with
indexes 1,2,3 ...,20. Clicking on a buton should alert its index.
For example, clicking on the first button(the left most) should alert 1,
and clicking on the last button (the rightmost) should similarly alert 20.
